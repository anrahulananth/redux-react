#React Redux example

I have written simple application to work with React, Redux and Redux Thunk.

There are three source folders

1. complete1

    Built with Redux Concepts

2. complete2

    Integrated `react-redux` library

3. complete3

    Integrated `redux-thunk` middleware

Change the import in `index.js` to change the application

This application is bootstrapped with CRA. Please look into CRA docs for working with it.
